Overview :

A FREE light weight library for encoding and encrypting files or text. This library can be used within your existing software, used on a command line using a console or within script files.

Software is free and can be used in any private or commercial product.

Practical Usages
1. Hiding files on a hard drive, external drives, or online
Files can be hidden in plain sight, online, and decoded when required. Take a close look at the headers in this section! When sending a message, anyone looking to find out what you've sent would need to download every image, visually inspect each one, then try and crack the message (which could take decades even with the library). Plus, what if you put decoy images in!

2. Protecting files online
When uploading sensitive files online like images, documents, etc, no matter the security, online hackers will find away of getting it. With AI now trawling the internet looking for training material, your data could be stolen and used for AI purposes or worse. Using PIE could stop this and protect/encrypt your online data.

3. Sending Text either via Chat or email
The original purpose of the library was to send encrypted text in a way so that agencies, IP, etc, would not be able to see it or decode it. As the message is an image and trillions of images are passed via communications every day, these images would not be detected, and even if they were, the process of hacking them would be so huge it would not be worth it. Text would be encoded and encrypted into an image then sent directly via email, FTP, HTTPS, etc The recipient would then decode and decrypt the image and no one would be any the wiser. See "encryption" and "decryption" for more details. You could write software to do the entire process of encoding and decoding so only your friends, customers, etc, could get the information.Â 

4. Copyright tagging
One of the encoding modes available is to make the encoded image completely transparent. This means you can encode and encrypt some text for a file and hide it inside a PDF, a document, within software, or anything that allows a file. The image would not be viewable and therefore if it comes to a law suit or something the file can be extracted and decoded and decrypted. Showing your copyright data or what ever you like.

Files encoded can be semi or fully transparent.
